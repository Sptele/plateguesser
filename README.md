# Plate Guesser

Do you think you should work for the DMV? Play this game and find out! Decide, based on the license plate, the customer's reason, and your own wits, if the California DMV **approved** or **denied** the plate. Additionally, enable (or disable) the DMV's own comments for help.

Play either Arcade mode, where you can play freely, or Ranked mode, where your score is put on the leaderboard (Top 50 shown only!), and just have fun!

If you want to support this game, just play it or send it to your friends.
